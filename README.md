# Scuba Diving
Scuba Duba Do is a web application built using Java EE 8 and Java Server Faces. It is designed for planning and booking scuba diving trips, simplifying the process by centralizing equipment rental, boat chartering,
and diving certifications in one  platform. The system caters to both novice tourists and diving enthusiasts, offering functionalities like searching and reserving various diving-related items and allowing administrators to manage listings effectively.

**Disclaimer**:
The application was done as a college project, and as such, the focus was on implementing core functionality, rather than on robust security. In other words, the passwords were NOT encrypted, hashed, salted, nor otherwise secured during transmission and/or storage. 
Needless to say, this would not be done in production-ready application.

## Dependencies
- NetBeans 12.0 (newer versions probably work as well)
- Java EE 8
- Glassfish 4
- MariaDB 10
Other project dependencies are included within netbeansLib. In addition, in sql/mysql.sql you can find SQL file for populating the tables, as well as necessary login credentials.

## Screenshots
Below are couple of screenshots showcasing most, though not all, pages and functionality.
